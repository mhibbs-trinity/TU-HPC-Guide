# Trinity University HPC cluster Guide

## Description of the Cluster

Trinity maintains a 42 node HPC (high performance computing) cluster available for use by the general university community. The cluster was obtained through the support of the National Science Foundation. Any work published or presented with the aid of the cluster should acknowledge grant award **NSF MRI-ACI-1531594** as well as Trinity University for their support of the cluster.

### Technical specification of the Cluster

The cluster consists of a "head" node which is used to log onto the cluster and is where all jobs are submitted. There are also several "worker" or "remote" nodes where the bulk of computation should occur. This includes regular CPU-focused nodes, and specialized nodes with GPUs and a node with a large amount of RAM.

The head node specs are:
* Dual Intel Xeon ES-2680 v3
  * 24 cores total (12 per CPU)
  * 2.5 GHz clock speed
* 64 GB of RAM
